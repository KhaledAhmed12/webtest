      <h1>10 most influential people in the world</h1>
      <h3>
        This is a list chosen by Michael H. Hart, from the book ‘100 most influential people in the world’.
        He chose people on a ranking of who had done the most to influence the world.
        I recommend reading the book as it offers an interesting insight into the influence of different individuals.
        As the author notes, ‘Influential’ does not include a judgement on whether they influenced the world for the better or worse.
